# UXDI - Code in a Day ⚔️

This is code from the day of brain breaking where I turned everyone in UXDI31's brain to mush.

## Reasons why I'm cool 🍑

* Love the color Chartreuse
* Use the term "my dude"
* Refuse to use the term "dudette"
* Am generally considered funny _(but looks aren't everything)_
